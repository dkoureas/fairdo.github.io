The FAIR Digital Object is a Digital Object (DO) (DO as defined by [Robert Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn) in the early 1990s) that brings together the idea of interoperable digital objects and [FAIR principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) together. FAIR Digital Objects can represent data, software, protocols or other research resources. They are accompanied by persistent identifiers (PID) and metadata rich enough to enable them to be reliably found, used and cited (<a href="https://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.2317b12321764f669c92ebbcf7518164">FAIR Implementation Report, Wittenburg & Strawn 2019</a>).
