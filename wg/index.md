Current working groups endorsed by the steering commitee

1.FDO-eING eInfrastructure Group

This group will focus on the interaction and involvement of the big data and computing centres in the FDO related work. These big data centres have an even more important role in the future since they need to take care of persistent services that go beyond their traditional business in providing basic networking, storage and computing services. If FDO as basic interoperability infrastructure wants to be accepted, they need to support essential registries of all sorts (PIDs, Types, Assertions, etc.) in a persistent and 24/7 availability mode.

2.FDO-BIG Basic Infrastructure Group

A fully functioning FDO landscape is dependent on a well-organised and operational infrastructure of basic components that can be used by every researcher at the end.
