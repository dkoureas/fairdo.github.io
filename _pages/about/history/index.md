The Digital Objects have been defined in early papers by R. Kahn and the work in various RDA groups, in particular in the RDA Data Foundation & Terminology WG. Initiativs such as C2CAMP and GEDE have taken up the work on DOs and exchanged ideas about impleementations and plans (for activities see here: https://github.com/GEDE-RDA-Europe/GEDE/tree/master/Digital-Objects). Intensive discussions during the last few months including colleagues from GOFAIR resulted in the knowledge that the DO Model needs to be extended by explicit semantics to meet the emerging criteria of the FAIR Maturity Indicator work and to make them machine actionable.

An international workshop was held in Paris where the participants agreed to write an FDO Document that can be signed to form a broad community, to build a coordination group to organise the community and a technical expert group to advance the FDO specifications. Due to a few activities around EOSC and COVID this work got stuck and will be taken up again in 2021. This folder is meant to host from now on all documents related to the FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) and the FDO Framework specifying the requirements. Also in the case of FDOs we will maintain the openness which characterises the GEDE collaboration.
